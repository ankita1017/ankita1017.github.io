Hi, I am an independent data consultant focusing on providing product analytics solutions. Previously, I worked as a product data scientist at Sundial, a data success manager at Atlan, and a Sr. data analyst at SocialCops.

I love to record my experiences and musings mainly through - writing and sometimes using data-art, zines, and sketchnotes. Always on the lookout for novel mediums to visualize information!

3 Random facts: My academic background is in Economics. I am a newsletter buff. My day feels incomplete without a stroll and coffee.
